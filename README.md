# Kasparro Assignment
This assignment, _Kasparro - Backend & ETL Systems_, is designed to simulate owning a small production backend system end-to-end. It is structured into three tiers: P0 (Foundation), P1 (Growth Layer), and P2 (Differentiator Layer)
## Goals

 **P0 - Foundation Layer**

 1. Data Ingestion
 2. Backend API Service
 3. Dockerized, Runnable System
 4. Minimal Test Suite	

 **P1 - Growth Layer**
 

 1. Add a Third Data Source
 2. Improved Incremental Ingestion
 3. */stats* Endpoint
 4. Comprehensive Test Coverage
 5. Clean Architecture

 **P2 - Differentiator Layer**
 

 1. Schema Drift Detection
 2. Failure Injection + Strong Recovery
 3. Rate Limiting + Backoff
 4. Observability Layer
 5. DevOps Enhancements
 6. Run Comparison / Anomaly Detection
